## Quick review
Last course, we learned about some Data Structure:
1. Array
	- 1D
	- 2D
	- etc.
2. Linked List
	- Singly Linked List
	- Doubly Linked List
	- Ordered
	- Circular
3. Structure
4. Array/Linked List of structure elements
## Warm-up
1. Given an array of $N$ integer in ascending order, you are asked to implement the following functions:
   1. Find out $X$ from the array
      ```cpp
      // The function return the index of the arbitrary element X
      int findX(int* a, int n, int x);
      ```
      ![[findX code]]
   2. Find out the $1^{st}$ $X$ from the array 
      ```cpp
      // The function return the index of the first element X
      int find1stX(int* a, int n, int x);
      ```
      ![[find1stX code]]
2. Given a SLL of $N$ integers, you are asked to implement a function to reverse every $k$ elements from the list.
   ```cpp
   void reverseEveryK(Node* &pHead, int k);
   ```
   ![[reverseEveryK code]]
